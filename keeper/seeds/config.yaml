# Config Seed Registry
# Machine-readable registry of configuration patterns
# Keeper uses this to enforce consistency in feature flags and environment config

feature_flags:
  # Example feature flag entry:
  # flag_name:
  #   description: "What this flag controls"
  #   default: true|false
  #   rollout: percentage|boolean|user_segment
  #   owner: "team or person responsible"
  #   lifecycle: experimental|stable|deprecated

  # Add your feature flags here after discovery with /keeper-plant
  # Example:
  # new_dashboard:
  #   description: "Enable redesigned dashboard"
  #   default: false
  #   rollout: percentage
  #   owner: "frontend-team"
  #   lifecycle: experimental

environment_vars:
  # Example environment variable entry:
  # VAR_NAME:
  #   required: true|false
  #   sensitive: true|false (true = should not be logged)
  #   used_by: [list, of, services]
  #   description: "What this variable configures"

  # Add your environment variables here after discovery with /keeper-plant
  # Example:
  # DATABASE_URL:
  #   required: true
  #   sensitive: true
  #   used_by: [api, worker]
  #   description: "Primary database connection string"

config_files:
  # Example config file entry:
  # filename:
  #   location: path/to/file
  #   format: yaml|json|toml|env
  #   purpose: "What this config controls"
  #   forbidden_modifications:
  #     - list of things not to change

  # Add your config files here after discovery with /keeper-plant
