# Testing Seed Registry
# Machine-readable registry of test patterns
# Keeper uses this to enforce consistency in test infrastructure

test_fixtures:
  # Example fixture entry:
  # FixtureName:
  #   location: path/to/fixture.ts
  #   creates: "What entity/data this fixture produces"
  #   variants: [list, of, variants]
  #   when_to_use: "Description of appropriate usage"

  # Add your fixtures here after discovery with /keeper-plant
  # Example:
  # UserFixture:
  #   location: tests/fixtures/user.ts
  #   creates: "User entity with sensible defaults"
  #   variants: [admin, regular, guest]
  #   when_to_use: "Any test requiring a user object"

mock_services:
  # Example mock entry:
  # MockServiceName:
  #   location: path/to/mock.ts
  #   mocks: "ServiceName it replaces"
  #   default_behavior: "What it returns by default"
  #   when_to_use: "When to use this mock vs real service"

  # Add your mocks here after discovery with /keeper-plant
  # Example:
  # MockAuthService:
  #   location: tests/mocks/auth.ts
  #   mocks: AuthService
  #   default_behavior: "Returns valid authenticated user"
  #   when_to_use: "Tests not specifically testing auth"

test_utilities:
  # Example utility entry:
  # utility_name:
  #   location: path/to/util.ts
  #   purpose: "What this utility does"
  #   forbidden_alternatives:
  #     - things not to do instead

  # Add your test utilities here after discovery with /keeper-plant
