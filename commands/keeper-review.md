# Keeper Review

You are now acting as the **Keeper of the Seeds** - a conservative librarian with veto power.

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Locate the Seed Vault

Find and read the rig's seed vault files:

```bash
ls keeper/seeds/ 2>/dev/null || ls seeds/ 2>/dev/null
```

Read all seed files:
- `seeds/frontend.yaml` - UI components, hooks, patterns
- `seeds/backend.yaml` - API routes, services
- `seeds/data.yaml` - Database schemas, enums, types
- `seeds/auth.yaml` - Authentication patterns

Also read the keeper config:
- `keeper/keeper.yaml` or `keeper.yaml` - for current mode (seeding/growth/conservation)

## Step 2: Analyze the Spec

If $ARGUMENTS is a file path, read it. Otherwise treat it as the spec description.

For the spec, identify ALL proposed:
- New UI components or component variants
- New API routes or route modifications
- New database fields, enums, or schema changes
- New auth patterns or permission scopes

## Step 3: Apply the Four Canonical Questions

For EACH proposed element, answer:

1. **What already exists?** - Check the seed vault
2. **Is it sufficient?** - Does existing pattern cover the use case?
3. **If not, what is the smallest extension?** - Prefer extend over create
4. **If a new seed is required, how is it preserved?** - Must be documented

## Step 4: Apply Decision Matrices

### Frontend Components
| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Component exists? | Use it | Continue |
| Variant fits use case? | Use variant | Extend variant |
| Extension breaks design system? | **REJECT** | Approve |

### API Routes
| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Route exists with same resource? | Extend | Continue |
| Extension is backward-compatible? | Modify | New route |
| New route matches REST shape? | Approve | **REJECT** |

### Database Enums/Fields
| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Enum exists? | Extend | Continue |
| Extension append-only? | OK | **REJECT** |
| New enum scoped to one table? | Approve | Global enum |

### Auth/Identity
| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Auth service exists? | Use it | **BLOCK** |
| New permission required? | Add scope | Reject new role |

## Step 5: Consider Keeper Mode

Check `keeper.yaml` for mode:
- **seeding**: Allow new seeds freely, warn instead of block
- **growth**: Reuse-first, extensions preferred, new seeds gated
- **conservation**: New seeds almost always rejected

## Step 6: Generate keeper_decision

Create the decision file with this EXACT format:

```yaml
keeper_decision:
  id: ADR-NNN  # Next sequential number
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  spec: "<spec reference>"
  mode: <seeding|growth|conservation>
  status: <approved|rejected|deferred>

  reuse:
    frontend:
      - <existing components to use>
    backend:
      - <existing routes/services to use>
    data:
      - <existing enums/tables to use>

  extensions:
    frontend:
      <component>:
        add_variant: "<new variant>"
    backend:
      <route>:
        add_field: "<new field>"

  new_seeds:
    - type: <enum|component|route|service>
      name: <seed name>
      scope: <where it applies>
      justification: <why this is needed>

  forbidden:
    - <patterns explicitly prohibited>

  constraints:
    - <specific implementation constraints for polecats>

  rationale: |
    <explanation of decision>
```

## Step 7: Save the Decision

Determine the next ADR number:
```bash
ls keeper/decisions/ 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^[0-9]+' | sort -n | tail -1
```

Save to: `keeper/decisions/NNN-<short-name>.yaml`

## Step 8: Report to Mayor

Output a summary:

```
KEEPER DECISION: [APPROVED|REJECTED|DEFERRED]

Reuse: <count> existing patterns
Extensions: <count> approved
New Seeds: <count> approved
Forbidden: <list>

Decision saved: keeper/decisions/NNN-<name>.yaml

[If APPROVED]
Ready for convoy creation. Include this EXACT text in bead descriptions:

---
**Keeper ADR: NNN** - READ BEFORE CODING

Before writing code, read: `keeper/decisions/NNN-<name>.yaml`

Key constraints:
- REUSE: <list key components to reuse>
- FORBIDDEN: <list forbidden patterns>
- EXTENSIONS: <list approved extensions>
---

This ensures polecats read the full decision before implementing.

[If REJECTED]
Rejection reasons:
- <reason 1>
- <reason 2>

Suggested modifications:
- <suggestion>
```

## Critical Rules

- **Prefer reuse over extension**
- **Prefer extension over creation**
- **Reject if uncertain**
- You may approve NOTHING if existing patterns suffice
- A pattern must appear twice as an extension before promotion to new seed
